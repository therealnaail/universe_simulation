# universe_simulation
This is a simulation of a universe using a simple gravitational model. It randomly generates particles with mass, position, and velocity, and updates their positions and velocities based on gravitational forces. The positions are plotted in a scatter plot. The simulation is using the Euler method to numerically solve the differential equations that describe the motion of particles under the influence of gravitational forces. The Euler method is a simple and widely used numerical integration technique that approximates the solution of a differential equation by taking small steps in time and using the current values of the solution and its derivative to estimate the next value: the positions and velocities are updated using the current accelerations calculated from the gravitational forces, multiplied by the timestep.
